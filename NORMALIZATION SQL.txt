Normalization

Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.

why is this required? 
Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. It is
also used to eliminate the undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion
Anomalies.

Types of Normal Forms

There are the four types of normal forms:
1st Normal Form (1NF)
2nd Normal Form (2NF)
3rd Normal Form (2NF)
BCNF

1st Normal Form (1NF)
A relation is in 1NF if it contains an atomic value.

2nd Normal Form (2NF)
2NF A relation will be in 2NF if it is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional
dependent on the primary key.

3rd Normal Form (2NF)
3NF A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and no transition dependency exists.

BCNF
4NF A relation will be in 4NF if it is in Boyce Codd normal form and has no multi-valued
dependency
